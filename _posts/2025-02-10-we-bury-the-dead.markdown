watched my first ever movie preview today

the movie was about a woman who goes down to the south of tassie to find her
husband after a megaweapon explodes

the main problem with the story is that it simultaneously wanted me to care
about the zombies and not care about them, they were mega-murder-machines, and
then they weren't, and its really hard to get the balance right in a horde
situation, where you suddenly have the narrow the narratives focus to a single
individual amongst that horde of otherwise killer zombies.

Even the fact that the movie implies (via verbalisation from a character) that
the people who come back as zombies have something unfinished, that motivation
is very unclear from the way the majority of the zombies behave and are
understood, so it seemed like a guess in universe which I guess we're meant
to randomly understand is true?
