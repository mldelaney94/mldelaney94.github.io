Open throat is a story about a thirsty mountain lion existing in the crevice of
humanity

its short, reads well

the perspective of the cat is singularly interesting, the whole thing
being such a fever dream as it gets pissed on and operates in an alien way
that it basically reminds me of hotline miami

I learned a new genre of fiction from this: xeno fiction, under which I
understand and think about Mal goes to war

A gay mountain lion living in the desiccated land underneath the Hollywood sign
in LA finds love and revenge.

If that tagline doesn't make you want to read this book then maybe you should
kill yourself.

This book isn't actually Madagayscar as I was initially expecting. Instead,
its xenofiction. A first-person narrative set inside an actual mountain lion,
with all the weirdness, poor understanding of humanity, and animalisticness that
that would entail.

Read it. 10/10.
